# Tokyo Drift 3D — task board

Source of task truth: `godot/docs/tasks/td-*.md` in `doublehidenblade/tokyo-drift-3d`.
One defect = one task. A task closes ONLY when its exact defect is fixed and verified — never because siblings were fixed.

Backfilled 2026-09-25 from the task files. 2026-09-25 reprioritization (Craig): online competitive play on the 3D base map is the sole priority. All non-multiplayer rows are paused/stashed. td-050–td-054 are the multiplayer milestone; td-055 done. Per Craig 2026-09-25, this table is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for task status — workers update it via PR (PR-based edits avoid merge conflicts).

> ID COLLISION WARNING: historical NEON records use bare `td-021`–`td-026`; Shuto records use `td-021-shuto`–`td-026-shuto` for the same numbers (Tokyo internal IDs td-021–026). Bare `td-027+` are Tokyo. Never overwrite historical NEON entries.
